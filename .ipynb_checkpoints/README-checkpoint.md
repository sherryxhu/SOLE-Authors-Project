# SOLE-Authors-Project

Some statistical science work for a project with the Duke Society of Labor Economics Lab.

There are two main results within this script: First, a data table with each author and the number of articles they have written or coauthored between 1983-2017 in the University of Chicago Press is generated. Second, a histogram is developed displaying the results.
